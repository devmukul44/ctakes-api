Patient is at high risk for heart failure but does not have structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure. Patient is ACC/AHA stage A. Measures include treat hypertension and encourage smoking cessation. Initial daily dose includes Captopril 6 mg. ;
Patient has a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and is to be screened with a comprehensive history and physical examination together with echocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography every 2-5 years. Patient is high risk for heart failure. Measures include treat lipid disorders and encourage regular exercise. Maximum daily dose of Fosinopril is 40 mg once;
Patient is asymptomatic with LV dysfunction from previous MI, LV remodeling from LV hypertrophy. In addition to the heart failure education and aggressive risk factor modification used for stage A, treatment with an ACEI/ARB and/or beta-blockade is indicated. Initial daily dose includes Enalapril 2 mg twice. Maximum daily dose of Captopril includes 50 mg.;
Patient is diagnosed with asymptomatic valvular dysfunction. Evaluation for coronary revascularization either percutaneously or surgically, as well as correction of valvular abnormalities, may be indicated. Treatment with an ICD for primary prevention of sudden death in patients with an LVEF of less than 30% that is more than 40 days post-MI is reasonable if expected survival is more than 1 year. Initial daily dose includes Lisinopril 6 mg.;
Patient has structural heart disease and current or previous symptoms of heart failure. The preventive measures include dietary sodium restriction. Drugs routinely recommended  include ACEI/ARBs, beta-blockers, and loop diuretics for fluid retention. Initial daily dose includes Perindopril 2 mg once.;
Patient has refractory heart failure (NYHA class IV) that requires specialized interventions. Treatment considerations include heart transplantation or placement of an LV assist device in eligible patients, pulmonary catheterization. Maximum daily dose of Quinapril is 20 mg twice.;
Symptoms shown are fluid retention and weight gain, Loss of appetite and Abnormally slow heart rate. Patient with weakened heart, is showing symptoms for advanced heart failure. The medications include Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), beta blockers and Diuretics. Initial daily dose includes Ramipril 2 mg.;
The muscles of the heart pumps (ventricles) have become thin and weakened. They stretch (dilate) and cannot pump the blood with enough force to reach all the body's tissues. Patient is suffering from ACC/AHA Stage A Heart failure. Maximum daily dose of Losartan 50 mg.;
Patient is with weakened heart muscles which cannot pump enough blood throughout the body. The left ventricle is stretched (dilated). Fluid backs up and accumulates in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Previous episode of heart attack, confirming doubt for systolic heart failure. Initial daily dose includes Valsartan 40 mg twice.;
Patient has a history of high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation (a disturbance in heart rhythm) and is suspected to suffer from preserved LVEF heart failure. The force of the heart muscle contractions weakened over time, and the muscles have difficulty relaxing which is preventing the normal filling of the heart with blood. Maximum daily dose of Valsartan is 160 mg twice.
